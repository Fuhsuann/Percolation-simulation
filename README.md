# Percolation-simulation

The program simulation.py takes a value n and generates a configuration of the critical percolation on a n/2xn/2 square. Then the program will output four images
1. The percolation configuration (in silver)
2. The lowest crossing (in red)
3. The lowest cluster on the dual graph (in dark grey)
4. A shortest crossing (in black)

To run the program, just open the terminal and type
```
user$ python3 simulation.py
```
